# Philosophers

Environment Simulator for the Dining Philosophy Problem. </br>

Working with parallelism, implementing algorithms to avoid deadlocks. Tools and technologies:
linux threads, mutexes, semaphores. </br>

Arguments: number_of_philosophers, time_to_die, time_to_eat,
time_to_sleep,
[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]</br>

- number_of_philosophers: The number of philosophers and also the number
of forks.
- time_to_die (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didn’t start eating time_to_die
milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.
- time_to_eat (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat.
During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
- time_to_sleep (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
- number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional argument): If all
philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat
times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a
philosopher dies.

Each philosopher has a number ranging from 1 to number_of_philosophers.
- Philosopher number 1 sits next to philosopher number number_of_philosophers.
Any other philosopher number N sits between philosopher number N - 1 and philosopher number N + 1.
